                    <h3>Ren’Py - Game making tool</h3>
                    
                        <p>We chose Ren'Py as the engine for Greywater Cove because it is the most popular choice for visual novels and has a large community with many resources. Its coding system is relatively easy to learn, making it accessible for beginners. Initially, we considered using Twine, but we found it too difficult to grasp.</p>

                        <p>Several players mentioned that the ear ringing sound effect was too loud and triggering. After receiving this feedback from three people (everyone who tested the game), we decided to replace it with a heart-pounding sound, which feels more immersive and less jarring.</p>
